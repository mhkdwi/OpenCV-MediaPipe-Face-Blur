# OpenCV-MediaPipe-Face-Blur
This project demonstrates how to use MediaPipe and OpenCV to automatically detect and blur human faces in images, videos, or live webcam streams. Itâ€™s a lightweight and privacy-focused computer vision application built in Python. Ideal for anonymizing people in visual data while maintaining the context of the scene.
